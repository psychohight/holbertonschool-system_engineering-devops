Additional server: It helps distribute the load and add redundancy. If one server fails, the second one can take over.

Load balancer (HAProxy): It distributes user requests between the two servers. For example, with a round-robin algorithm, requests are sent sequentially to each server.

Load balancing algorithms:

    Active-Active: Both servers receive requests simultaneously, improving performance and reducing wait times.
    
    Active-Passive: One server handles all the requests, while the other is on standby and only takes over in case the primary server fails.

Database cluster (Primary-Replica):

    The Primary server is the one that receives and processes all modification (write) requests.
    
    The Replicas receive a copy of the data from the Primary, handle read requests, and provide redundancy in case of a failure.

Issues with this infrastructure:

    SPOF (Single Point of Failure): If the load balancer fails and is not redundant, the entire infrastructure becomes unusable.

    Security: The lack of a firewall and HTTPS makes the system vulnerable to attacks.

    Lack of monitoring: Without monitoring tools, it is difficult to detect and quickly resolve performance issues or failures.
