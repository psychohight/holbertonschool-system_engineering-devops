    ------------------------------
         web server(Nginx)
         application server
         database (MySQL)
    ------------------------------

Server: It is a computer connected to the Internet that hosts services such as a website. In this case, it hosts Nginx, the web application, and the MySQL database.

Domain name (foobar.com): It serves as a human-readable address to reach your server. A DNS record (type A) is used to link www.foobar.com to the IP address 8.8.8.8.

Web server (Nginx): It handles HTTP/HTTPS requests from users and routes them to the application. Nginx receives a request from the user, asks the application to process it, and then returns the response to the client.

Application server: The application is hosted here. This is where the code and logic of your website reside.

Database (MySQL): It stores the structured data necessary for your application to function properly, such as user information, messages, etc.

Communication protocol: The server communicates with the user via the HTTP protocol (or HTTPS for added security).

Issues with this infrastructure:

SPOF (Single Point of Failure): If the single server fails, the website will be inaccessible.

Downtime: During updates or when deploying new versions of the code, the server must be restarted, which leads to service interruption.

No scalability: With only one server, if traffic increases significantly, the server could become overloaded and make the website unavailable.
